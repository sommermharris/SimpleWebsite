<h1>Forum Launch on the Nexus of Arts, Sciences, and Humanities at UNAS</h1>
  
    <p>In 2018, I worked as a Program Development Officer for a year at the <a href="https://sommerharris.com/files/Education_Systems_in_Eastern_Africa_Singoff_January_2020.pdf">
      Uganda National Academy of Sciences (UNAS).</a> While I was there, I launched a forum on the Nexus of Arts, Sciences, and Humanities. This forum ultimately led to an
      international academic discussion on interdisciplinary education on the African continent.
      You can the forum's first publication <a href="https://sommerharris.com/files/Education_Systems_in_Eastern_Africa_Singoff_January_2020.pdf">here.</a>
