## About My Project

The general area for our research project is data visualization for instances of irresponsible artificial intelligence. This means that we research and improve the best practices for visualizing this kind of data, with domain experts being our main audience. We are working in observable notebook with d3 and Vega-Lite. The following interactive tool was built by John, our research advisor, to explore datasets. This tool is an example of what we would aim to build, or at least propose features for, during this project. This instance of the navio is loaded with data from our project, so you can also explore our dataset below.
